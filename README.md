Work in progress, but the following seem to work:
*   Grover's algorithm
*   Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
*   Simon's algorithm
*   Quantum Fourier Transform
*   Shor's algorithm
*   Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm
*   Quantum teleportation
*   Superdense coding
*   Quantum cryptography: BB84 protocol
*   CHSH inequality violation

Quantum error correction:

*   3-qubit error correcting a qubit-flip
*   3-qubit error correcting a sign-flip
*   Shor Code

Quantum adders:

*   Quantum half-adder for 1-qubit
*   Quantum full-adder for 1-qubits
*   Full adder for two N-qubit numbers
*   Draper adder

Simulation of quantum simulation:

*   Evolution in time with a Hamiltonian given as a sum of Pauli products with real coefficients
*   Evolution of a 1D Gaussian packet in time, solving the 1D time-dependent Schrodinger equation using a Trotter decomposition and quantum Fourier transform

Paradoxes (although some of the above might be considered paradoxes as well):
*   Quantum eraser
*   General Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb tester/interaction free measurement/counterfactual computation
*   Hardy's paradox
